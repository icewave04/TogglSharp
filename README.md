# TogglSharp
C# Implementation of Toggl V9 API [WIP]

Currently there is not public documentation for Toggl API V9, so the work being done here is based off of the public facing API calls from their website.

Currently this project is incomplete, and i wouldn't recommend using it at all right now.

The TogglSharp project is just a testing ground, there is a class library TogglSharpAPI which contains all of the classes.

There is a V8 and V9 namespace, the V8 namespace is incomplete. I was part way through development when, but Toggl Support informed me of the advent V9 API so I switched to developing for that. Toggl V8 will be removed soon.

# What's Next?
Complete V9 support, and Reports.

Along with the V9 API, Reports V3 is also being released. I've not started developing for that, but it will be added as another class library once I can.
From what I can see, the website is still using Reports V2 so I cannot develop anything for it without it being guess work.
